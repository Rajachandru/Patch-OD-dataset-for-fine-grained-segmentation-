# Patch-OD-dataset-for-fine-grained-segmentation-

The Patch dataset is created cropping patches of size 25 Χ 25,   29 Χ 29, 33 Χ 33 from the Fundus Images in DRISHTI- GS dataset. The patches are created around the borders of the Optical Disc (OD) and Optical Cup (OC) where there is maximum ambiguity. The patches will be useful  for fine grained learning for segmentation (For more details visit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmN2Vhtpr48&t=60s  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfiNGjAQGVw&t=15s  and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxhfNm16qOE&t=321s ). 
In this first version of the dataset we provide 5 sample patches of the above three sizes and their corresponding labels (labels cropped from the same spatial co-ordinates). Full datset may be released post paper publication.
